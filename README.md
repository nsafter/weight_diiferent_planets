The project contains a solar system with 9 planets and Sun at the center.
Since each planet has its own gravity factor, hence this project calculates the weight of an object on different planets with respect to weight of object on earth.
Threejs is used for creating the solar system and its 3D effect.
Using buttons corresponding to the planets, one can calculate the weight of object on different planets.
The input for Earth's weight has been taken as dynamic input using window.prompt
